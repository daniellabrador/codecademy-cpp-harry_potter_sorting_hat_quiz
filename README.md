# **Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz**

The Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz program asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `sortinghat.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ sortinghat.cpp -o sortinghat
./sortinghat
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
